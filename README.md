# Vue.js Server Side Rendering PHP Example

I was having some trouble getting the spatie/server-side-rendering library working so I thought it might be useful to put up this example once I figured it out.

I also wrote a blog post here https://rojas.io/vue-js-server-side-rendering-with-php/ that goes into detail of how to get it working using Node.
